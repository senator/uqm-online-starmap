Ur-Quan Masters Starmap
=======================

This is a mobile and web app that displays the starmap from "The
Ur-Quan Masters", the modern port of the classic game "Star Control II".

The data in this application comes from the source code from the modern
port, and both the contributors to that excellent project and the
legendary creators of the original game have my thanks.

Features
--------

    - Interact with the map to find out the name, position, size,
    color, and [TODO] mineral and biological wealth of star systems.
    Just mouseover on platforms that have mice or similar pointing
    devices, or [TODO] tap on mobile)

    - [TODO] Zoom and pan the map.

    - [TODO] Search for stars by name

    - [TODO] Recast the map with stars sized by mineral wealth or biological
    wealth instead of actual size (dwarf, giant, super giant) and see what's
    near you that's worth visiting.

    - [TODO] More!

Build dependencies
------------------

If you're going to build this app yourself, you need to put copies of
jquery and requirejs into the www/thirdparty directory, or change the
source to get them from CDNs if appropriate.
