Ur-Quan Masters Mobile Starmap
==============================

This is a mobile and web app that displays the starmap from "The
Ur-Quan Masters" (hereafter UQM), the modern port of the classic
game "Star Control II".

The data in this application comes from the source code from UQM and from
the UQM Starmap Viewer, and both the contributors to those projects and the
legendary creators of the original game have my thanks.

Features
--------

    - Interact with the map to find out the name, position, size,
    color, and [TODO] mineral and biological wealth of star systems.
    Just mouseover on platforms that have mice or similar pointing
    devices, or [TODO] tap on mobile)

    - [TODO] Zoom and pan the map.

    - [TODO] Search for stars by name

    - [TODO] Recast the map with stars sized by mineral wealth or biological
    wealth instead of actual size (dwarf, giant, super giant) and see what's
    near you that's worth visiting.

    - [TODO] More!

Build dependencies
------------------

If you're going to build this app yourself, you need to put copies of
jquery, requirejs, and knockout into the www/thirdparty directory, or
change the app source code to load them from CDNs as desired.
