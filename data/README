The JSON files in this directory contain data coaxed out of the source
code of The Ur-Quan Masters (thank you, contributors to that excellent
project!).

These files have whitespace in them to make any necessary editing or
tweaking easier.  They are not used directly by the application!  You
must run the $PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/make-data.js script (it requires
NodeJS) to build a condensed data module suitable for the app to load
using RequireJS.
