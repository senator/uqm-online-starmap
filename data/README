The JSON files in this directory contain data coaxed out of two sources:

    1) The source code of The Ur-Quan Masters (thank you, contributors
        to that excellent project!).
    2) A MySQL database dump from the UQM StarMap Viewer, a similar project
        to this one which I discovered part way through my development.
        Thank you <pez@apocalyptech.com>!  The files with names matching the
        glob pattern <world*.json> are derived from said database.

These files have whitespace in them to make any necessary editing or
tweaking easier.  They are not used directly by the application!  You
must run the $PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/build-data.js script (it requires
NodeJS) to build a condensed data module suitable for the app to load
using RequireJS.
