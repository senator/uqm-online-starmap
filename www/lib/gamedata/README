Do not delete this file. Git doesn't store empty directories.

This directory is here to receive the output of the make-data.js script,
which builds a condensed RequireJS module from the JSON files in the
$PROJECT_ROOT/data directory.  It's the built module that is actually
loaded by the app to get the game data.
