TODO (feature-wise and deeper)
==============================

- [IN PROGRESS] Implement zooming, probably by extending StarMapScale object

- [DONE] Fix color data, any other data derived from enums that
was out of order.

- Build as Android app with Cordova.

- Fill out menu bar with some (SVG?) icons or other controls

- Readout manager in the JS

- Menu manager in the JS

- HTML clean up

- Star search

- Draw lines for constellations

- Build just enough of the game source (to do with planet generation) to get
the mineral and bio counts per star system out of the game and into some data
file.  For bonus, translate the generation code into JS so that we can
potentially draw star systems on demand.

- Consider features that allow game players to keep track of systems they've
already visited (manually or via saved game upload?)
