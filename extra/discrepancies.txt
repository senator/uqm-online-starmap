Below are all the star systems whose mineral value totals as we calculate
them from data from UQM* differ from the totals published in the Star
Control II Role Playing Resource Guide.

I do not have an environment in which I can run the original DOS version
of the game anymore, so I can't be certain whether the totals in the
guide are incorrect or whether the DOS version of the game was different
than UQM in this regard.

However, I have a strong memory of the dozens if not hundreds of times
I mined the Sol system playing the game in the 1990s, and when I play
UQM today I don't notice anything different there, which may mean that
the total has always been UQM's 3,693 and not the guide's 4,008.

Nevertheless, it may be signifcant that every one of these star
systems with discrepancies contain alien homeworlds or other special
alien presences.  If the discrepancies were all positive, I might think
they represented minerals which you can only access if you allow the
the Kohr-ah to destroy the inhabitants and lower any slave shields.
But there are problems with that idea, not the least of which is that
many of the discrepancies are negative.
